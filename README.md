___This repository contains my Personal Portfolio Website, where I showcase my skills, experience, and various creative and coding projects. I designed this website to be responsive and to feature a clean, modern aesthetic.___

**Repository Structure:**
I've organized the repository to clearly separate the main portfolio pages from my individual coding projects:

**My Main Portfolio Pages:**
index.html: This is the main landing page for my portfolio.
resume.html: Here, I detail my professional skills and work experience.
photography.html: This section contains a gallery showcasing a collection of my photographs.
coding.html: This is a dedicated section where I list and describe my various coding projects.
My Coding Projects: These are located in the Coding Projects/ directory, and each HTML file represents a distinct web application or interactive tool I've developed.

**Assets:**
styles.css: This file contains the primary CSS rules for the overall website styling. I used an "Inter" font and a dark color palette, and some projects also incorporate Tailwind CSS.
script.js: This handles interactive elements, primarily the dropdown navigation that allows users to switch between sections of my portfolio.

**Technologies Used**
The projects within this repository are primarily built using:
HTML5: For structuring the content.
CSS3: For styling, with some projects utilizing the Tailwind CSS framework for utility-first styling.
JavaScript: For interactive functionalities and dynamic content generation.
